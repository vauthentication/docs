# vAuth Docs

These are the official docs for https://docs.vauth.wtf

## Development

The best way to go about developing vAuth documentation 
is by cloning the repo and utilizing 
JetBrains Writerside (https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/)

## Notes

- Pull requests are appreciated and will be looked at
- JetBrains Writerside is (at the time of writing) in an Early Preview stage and may be buggy at times
- The documentation should cover 100% of the public api as well as the officially published wrappers around the api
